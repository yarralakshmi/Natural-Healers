 <h2 id="intro">🪴The Introduction of Gotu kola</h2>
  <p>Gotu Kola is a small, creeping herb native to Asia, renowned in Ayurvedic and traditional Chinese medicine for its powerful healing and cognitive-enhancing properties. Often referred to as the "herb of longevity," it is known to promote mental clarity, improve memory, reduce anxiety, and support skin regeneration. Gotu Kola is rich in triterpenoids, which help in wound healing and boosting circulation. This low-growing plant prefers moist, shady areas and is ideal for medicinal herb gardens and indoor pots.

    <h3 id="history">🪴The History of Gotu kola</h3>
 <h3>🌱 Origins and Botanical Background</h3>
    <p>Gotu Kola is a small, creeping perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, as well as parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and thrives in moist, shady environments such as paddy fields, riverbanks, and wetlands. Known locally by various names — Mandukaparni in Sanskrit, Brahmi booti in Hindi (though distinct from Bacopa monnieri), and Vallarai in Tamil — it has been valued in multiple traditional healing systems for centuries.
</p>

<h3>🕊️ Ancient Egyptian Use</h3>
    <p>There is no direct evidence of Gotu Kola use in ancient Egypt, but Egyptian herbal practices did include similar water-loving plants for wound healing and mental tonics, which aligns with Gotu Kola’s known properties. It is possible that through trade, knowledge of this herb may have reached North Africa in later centuries.
</p>

<h3>🏛️ Greek and Roman Traditions</h3>
    <p>Gotu Kola was not part of the classical Greek or Roman pharmacopeia. However, their herbal traditions recognized plants with similar circulatory and cognitive benefits. It is likely that Gotu Kola remained primarily in Asian medicinal systems until global botanical exchanges began in later centuries.
</p>

<h3>📜 Medieval Herbalism in Europe</h3>
    <p>During the Middle Ages, Gotu Kola was largely unknown in Europe. However, it held an esteemed position in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). In Ayurveda, it was used to improve memory, heal wounds, and rejuvenate the body (rasayana therapy). In TCM, it was called Ji Xue Cao and was used for promoting longevity, reducing inflammation, and improving skin conditions.
</p>

<h3>🔬 Scientific Recognition and Taxonomy</h3>
        <p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, European botanists formally classified the plant as Centella asiatica. The Latin name reflects its Asian origins. Early scientific studies confirmed its antimicrobial, adaptogenic, and wound-healing properties, lending support to traditional uses.
</p>

<h3>⚗️ Rise in European Medicine</h3>
    <p>Gotu Kola entered European herbal medicine in the 19th century, primarily as a topical remedy for leprosy and chronic skin conditions. It gained a reputation for supporting skin repair and improving blood circulation. French and Indian researchers began studying its effects on varicose veins and tissue regeneration.
</p>

<h3>🌎 Transatlantic Expansion and Farming</h3>
    <p>Through colonial trade and botanical gardens, Gotu Kola spread to Africa, the Pacific, and the Americas. It became incorporated into local herbal traditions, particularly in island nations where it thrived in coastal wetlands.
</p>

<h3>🏭 Industrial Era Applications</h3>
    <p>By the early 20th century, Gotu Kola extracts were used in ointments, skin creams, and tonics. Its ability to stimulate collagen production made it a valuable ingredient in early anti-aging and scar-reduction products.
</p>

<h3>🌟 Modern-Day Relevance</h3>
    <p>Today, Gotu Kola is marketed worldwide as a herbal supplement for brain health, anxiety reduction, wound healing, and skin rejuvenation. It is used in teas, capsules, and topical formulations. In Sri Lanka, it is also enjoyed as a fresh salad for daily health maintenance.

    <h3 id="growing">How to Grow</h3>
 <h3>☀️ <strong>Ideal Growing Conditions</strong></h3>
<p>
Gotu Kola thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with partial shade and consistent moisture. It prefers warm temperatures ranging from 18°C to 30°C and high humidity levels. While it can tolerate full sun in cooler regions, partial shade is ideal to prevent leaf scorching. It grows best in sheltered spots like under taller plants or near water sources.
</p>

<h3>🧬 <strong>Propagation Methods</strong></h3>
<p>
Gotu Kola is easily propagated through root division or stem cuttings. Its creeping runners naturally spread across moist soil, forming dense mats. For faster propagation, select healthy stems with multiple nodes and plant them in damp soil. Root division is effective for rejuvenating older plants and expanding coverage in garden beds.
</p>

<h3>🌾 <strong>Soil Preparation</strong></h3>
<p>
This herb prefers moist, rich, loamy soil with excellent drainage. Incorporating compost, leaf mulch, or well-rotted manure enhances soil fertility and texture. The ideal pH range is between 5.5 and 7.0. Raised beds or containers with organic-rich soil help maintain optimal growing conditions and prevent waterlogging.
</p>

<h3>💧 <strong>Watering and Maintenance</strong></h3>
<p>
Gotu Kola requires consistently moist soil, especially during dry spells. Avoid allowing the soil to dry out completely, as this can stunt growth and reduce leaf quality. Mulching with straw or leaf litter helps retain moisture and suppress weeds. Regular care ensures healthy, vibrant foliage.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Water deeply 2–3 times a week, adjusting for rainfall</li>
  <li>Apply compost or <strong>organic fertilizer</strong> monthly during the growing season</li>
  <li>Prune regularly to encourage bushy growth and prevent legginess</li>
</ul>

<h3>🚫 <strong>Managing Growth and Spread</strong></h3>
<p>
Gotu Kola spreads rapidly through runners and can become invasive if left unchecked. To manage its growth, consider planting in containers, hanging baskets, or raised beds. Regular trimming of runners and edges helps maintain shape and prevents it from overtaking nearby plants. Periodic thinning also improves airflow and reduces disease risk.
</p>

<h3>✂️ <strong>Harvesting Tips</strong></h3>
<p>
Harvest young, tender leaves and stems as needed for culinary or medicinal use. Frequent trimming not only provides a steady supply but also stimulates lush regrowth. Use clean scissors or shears to avoid damaging the plant. For best flavor and potency, harvest in the morning when oils are most concentrated.
